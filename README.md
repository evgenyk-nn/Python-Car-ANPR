# Python-Car-ANPR
Python Car ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) is a system for recognizing and reading vehicle license plates, implemented using the Python programming language. It is designed to automatically detect and recognize the license plates of vehicles in images or videos. An ANPR system can be useful in various scenarios, such as automated parking systems, video surveillance, traffic management, and road safety. It can process video streams or static images, extract license plates, recognize the text on the plates, and provide information about the recognized numbers. Python provides a wide range of libraries and tools for developing an ANPR system, such as OpenCV for image and video processing, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning model training, and text recognition libraries like Tesseract or EasyOCR. Implementing an ANPR system using Python allows for flexible and customizable solutions that can be adapted to specific needs and usage conditions.
